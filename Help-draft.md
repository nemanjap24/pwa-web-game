# Legend
- red circle = ball, you play as it, you are balling through the levels
- black circle = finish, destination, you go there to get to the next level
- smaller yellow circle = coin, you have to pick up all of the coins to get to the finish line
- white squares = walls, you cannot roll through those (or you are not supposed to be able to get through them xd)

# WIP
- blue square= if you hit it it will reset your position
-
